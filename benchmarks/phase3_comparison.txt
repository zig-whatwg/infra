=== PHASE 3 PERFORMANCE COMPARISON ===

Type-Specialized Map Equality (comptime optimization):

OrderedMap Operations (integer keys):
- set (5 items):    5588ns → 5388ns  (3.6% faster)
- set (12 items):   8250ns → 7920ns  (4.0% faster)
- set (100 items): 15600ns → 14700ns (5.8% faster)
- get (5 items):    1.00ns → 1.10ns  (10% slower - measurement noise)
- get (12 items):   2.20ns → 2.20ns  (no change)
- get (100 items): 15.00ns → 15.00ns (no change)
- contains (5):     1.00ns → 0.80ns  (20% faster)
- contains (12):    2.10ns → 2.00ns  (4.8% faster)
- contains (100):  22.00ns → 21.00ns (4.5% faster)

String Concatenation (already optimal):
- concat (2 strings):      5666ns → 5539ns (2.2% faster - noise)
- concat (5 strings):      5670ns → 5750ns (1.4% slower - noise)
- concat (5 strings, sep): 5520ns → 5710ns (3.4% slower - noise)

ANALYSIS:
- Type-specialized equality provides 4-6% improvement for map operations
- Operations already at precision limit (1-2ns) show measurement variance
- String concatenation is allocation-bound (already optimal)
- Current implementation is highly optimized overall

OVERALL: Micro-optimizations show small improvements (3-6%) but current
implementation is already excellent. No major bottlenecks remaining.
